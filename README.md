# Ubiheard ðŸ“£

Ubiheard was a FedEx day project done at the Ubisoft Club, inspired by the [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) platform. It's a quick mock-up of a web app, written in AngularJS, styled with Bootstrap, and having all the "back-end" mocked with the browser's LocalStorage API.


## How to Run

We didn't actually include npm in this app, so run the static files on the server of your choice.

Recommended:

1. Install http-server: `npm install -g http-server`
2. Run local server with: `http-server`
